''' Making multiple updates to weights

You're now going to make multiple updates so you can dramatically improve your model weights, and see how the predictions improve with each update.

To keep your code clean, there is a pre-loaded get_slope() function that takes input_data, target, and weights as arguments. There is also a get_mse() function that takes the same arguments. The input_data, target, and weights have been pre-loaded.

This network does not have any hidden layers, and it goes directly from the input (with 3 nodes) to an output node. Note that weights is a single array.

We have also pre-loaded matplotlib.pyplot, and the error history will be plotted after you have done your gradient descent steps. '''

n_updates = 20
mse_hist = []

# Iterate over the number of updates
for i in range(n_updates):
    # Calculate the slope: slope
    slope = get_slope(input_data ,target , weights)
    
    # Update the weights: weights
    weights = weights - 0.01 * slope
    
    # Calculate mse with new weights: mse
    mse = get_mse(input_data ,target , weights)
    
    # Append the mse to mse_hist
    mse_hist.append(mse)

# Plot the mse history
plt.plot(mse_hist)
plt.xlabel('Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.show()
