'''   You'll now create a classification model using the titanic dataset, 
which has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called df. 
You'll take information about the passengers and predict which ones survived.

The predictive variables are stored in a NumPy array predictors.
The target to predict is in df.survived, though you'll have to manipulate 
it for keras. The number of predictive features is stored in n_cols.

Here, you'll use the 'sgd' optimizer, which stands for Stochastic 
Gradient Descent. You'll learn more about this in the next chapter! '''
